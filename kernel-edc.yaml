    # NOTE: sentinelhub depends on boto3, which will trigger an update of boto and
    #       botocore because conda has installed an older version of botocore because
    #       aiobotocore needs an older version of botocore.
    #       However since this pinning is handled by conda, pip will ignore it and update
    #       anyway, leading to an invalid version combination.
    #       https://github.com/aio-libs/aiobotocore/issues/904
    #       To work around this, we reinstall aiobotocore with pip to make it resolve dependencies
    #       again. Note that this could break conda dependencies, but should lead to a consistent
    #       set of versions of the boto libraries.
